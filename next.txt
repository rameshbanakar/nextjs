what is next.js?
next js is javascript framework for building web applications
when we are using react alone it is not possible to create fully fussible applications for production
next.js uses the react for user interfaces and provide the additional feature for fully production ready 
applications


why next.js?
it simplifies the development of appliocation for the production
1)Routing
2)API Routes
3)Rendering
4)Data fetching
5)Styling
6)Optimization


React server component?
React server componet is new arcitecture intriduced by the react team in version 18 which is quickly 
embraced by the next.js
The achitecture introduces a new way of creating react component,splitting them into two types:
--server component
--client component


1)server component:
in next.js all componet are server based componet by default
They have the ability to run the task like reading the file are fetching the data from the database
however they dont have ability to use hooks or handle intrations

2)clinet component
To create a client component it's neccessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file
the client componet can't perform th task like reading file but they have the ability to use the hooks and manage 
intrations


Routing:
next.js has file-based system routing mechanism
URL paths that user can access in browser are defined by file and folders  inyour code based


Routing convetions:
All Route must be placed inside the App folders
Every file that corresponds to the route must be named page.js or page.tsx

Every folder corresponds to path segment in the browser URL



private folder:
A private folder indiacate that  it is a private implementation details and should not be considered by the routing system

the folder and all subfolder excluded from the routing
prefix the folder name with an underscore


private folder contd:

for separating UI logic from the routing logic
for consistently organising internal folders across the project
for sorting and grouping in the code editor
And finally for avoiding potential naming conflict with the future next.js file convetions


Route groups:
allows us to logically group our routes and project fies without affeting the URL path structure
